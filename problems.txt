1) Not properly implementing/putting catch block or error not handled properly, it throws warning
 UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function 
 without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch() .
 Solution : write try/catch block properly
 Code : try{ ...}
         catch(err){...}
         
2) Problem of multiple server running at same time on same port
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3000
Solution :
 1) sudo lsof -i :3000 // get which process running on port 3000
 2) kill -9 {PID}

         
3) Calling markdown input in backend even if it removed from frontend . I want to remove the markdown input 
Error:  Article validation failed: markdown: Path `markdown` is required.
