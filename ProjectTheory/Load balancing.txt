- What is load balancing ? 
Load balancing is an approach to distribute and allocate traffic of website to multiple application servers.
The load balancer stays in between the client and application servers and decides on which server this request should go.
The decision can be configured using different algorithms.By default it uses Round-robin algorithm .


Code written in conf.d file in nginx :

upstream app_servers {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    server 127.0.0.1:3001;
    server 127.0.0.1:3002;
    server 127.0.0.1:3002;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;    // Eg : server localhost ;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host      $http_host;
        proxy_pass         http://app_servers;
    }
}
