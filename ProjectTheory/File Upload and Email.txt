1) File Upload using Multer : 

- What is multer ?
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data( mostly this encoding method should be used during file upload otherwise 
similar like application/x-www-form-urlencoded ), 
which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top 
of the busboy( A node.js module for parsing incoming HTML form data.) for maximum efficiency.

- Uploading using Grid-Fs-Storage : 
GridFS uses two collections to store file data. The default names are fs.files and fs.chunks. 
The first collection holds the metadata of the file, including name, size, content type etc. 
The second collection is where the magic happens. The fs.chunks collection holds the actual file,
which has been broken into chunks, default size 255kb. The chunks are stored as separate documents, that are numbered. 
The MongoDB driver you are using will assemble these chunks in order, when you want to retrieve the file.
